# sloan-ipsum

In the tradition of the silly ipsum, gives you (n) paragraphs of randomly-strung-together Sloan lyrics to use as placeholder text, for a lyric game, whatever you like.

A hearty thank you to the maintainers of [sloanmusic.com](http://www.sloanmusic.com) for putting up with my scraper. Please buy Sloan albums. I am not making any money from this, it's just a fun time.

Looks like this (or [go here to demo](http://ruhee.ca/sloan-ipsum)).
